# starter-kit-contentful
This is a starter kit used for initializing a new Orchid Lead project.

Initialize a new project with the following command `orchid-lead init --with orchid-lead/starter-kit-contentful`. Note, this starter kit requires the Contentful SDK for JavaScript.

```bash
npm install contentful
```

This is a great starting point for someone who wants to generate HTML from Handlebars files with data pulled from Contentful.

This project comes with two examples of using entires from Contentful. One example shows how to use multiple entries to generate one HTML file and the other example show how to use multiple entries to generate multiple HTML files.
